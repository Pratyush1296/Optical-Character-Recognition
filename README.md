# Optical-Character-Recognition
This repository has been created as part of my Data Science and Business Analytics Internship (GRIP) at the Sparks Foundation. 
The current task is to identify and extract text from an image. This task falls under the domain of Computer Vision and IoT. The images used for testing have been added to the repository as well.

The opencv-python library along with easyocr has been used. It was found that easyocr was able to detect text better than pytesseract (another package for extracting the text from images).
